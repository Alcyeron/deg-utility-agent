Demand Flexibility Programs in San Francisco
1. Executive Summary:
San Francisco stands at the forefront of energy innovation, demonstrating a robust and multifaceted approach to demand flexibility, also known as demand response or load flexibility. A diverse array of programs is available to both residential and commercial customers, offered by key entities such as Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), CleanPowerSF, Hetch Hetchy Power, and numerous third-party aggregators.1 These initiatives are designed to encourage customers to adjust their electricity consumption in response to various signals, primarily during periods of peak demand or grid stress. For residential customers, programs range from automated technologies that optimize energy use to reward-based systems for reducing consumption on hot summer days.1 Commercial customers have access to a wider variety of options, including time-based pricing structures, interruptible service agreements, and aggregator-managed programs.5 The existence of these multiple avenues for participation, offered by a range of providers, points to a mature and active market for demand-side management within the city. This comprehensive strategy underscores the importance placed on managing energy demand across all sectors in San Francisco. The development and implementation of these programs are closely aligned with California's broader energy policies, particularly the ambitious goals for grid reliability and the integration of increasing amounts of renewable energy sources.6 By actively engaging both homes and businesses in managing their energy consumption, San Francisco is taking significant strides towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.
2. Introduction to Demand Flexibility:
Demand flexibility, often referred to as demand response or load flexibility, is the practice of intentionally adjusting electricity consumption in response to signals from the grid.6 These signals can take the form of dynamic pricing, where the cost of electricity varies based on the time of day or grid conditions, or reliability alerts, which are issued when the electric grid is under strain and at risk of instability.8 The core principle behind demand flexibility is to incentivize or enable electricity consumers to reduce, increase, or shift their energy usage to better match the available supply.8 This capability is becoming increasingly vital in modern power grids, especially in regions like California that are experiencing a significant increase in renewable energy generation.6 Solar and wind power, while clean and sustainable, are inherently variable, producing energy only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.6 To ensure a reliable electricity supply, it is crucial to have mechanisms in place that can adjust demand to align with these fluctuations in renewable energy production.6 Demand flexibility plays a critical role in achieving this balance. Beyond simply matching supply and demand, effective demand flexibility programs offer several key benefits. They enhance grid reliability by reducing peak demand, which can strain the system and lead to blackouts.1 Economically, they can help avoid the need for constructing expensive new power plants, particularly those that are only used during peak demand periods, and they can also lower energy costs for participating consumers through incentives or reduced rates.1 Environmentally, demand flexibility contributes to sustainability by decreasing the reliance on fossil fuel-based power generation, which is often used to meet peak demand.1 The concept of demand response has evolved considerably over time. Initially, it primarily focused on encouraging customers to reduce their energy consumption during periods of high demand.8 However, with the increasing complexity of the grid and the growth of renewable energy, the definition has broadened to include shifting electricity consumption from peak hours to times when energy supply is more plentiful, and even increasing consumption when there is an oversupply of renewable energy on the grid.8 This more dynamic and integrated approach allows for a more efficient and resilient energy system. A significant factor enabling the widespread adoption and effectiveness of demand flexibility is the increasing penetration of smart devices and automation technologies.6 Smart thermostats, advanced pool pump controls, smart electric vehicle (EV) chargers, home batteries, and advanced water heater controls can all be programmed to automatically adjust their energy usage in response to grid signals or pricing changes.6 This automation makes participation in demand flexibility programs more seamless and less reliant on active intervention by consumers, thereby increasing both participation rates and the overall impact of these programs.
3. Demand Response Programs by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E):
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), as the primary investor-owned utility serving San Francisco, offers a comprehensive suite of demand response programs designed to engage both residential and business customers in managing their energy consumption.1 These programs aim to reduce the strain on the electric grid during periods of peak demand, which often occur on hot summer afternoons and evenings. A key feature of most of PG&E's demand response offerings is the provision of financial incentives to customers who participate by reducing their energy usage when called upon.1 PG&E's approach includes both programs that they directly manage and those offered through partnerships with contracted third-party providers.1 Generally, eligibility for these programs requires customers to be on an eligible rate schedule with PG&E.1
Residential Demand Response Programs: PG&E provides several options for homeowners looking to participate in demand response.1 The Automated Response Technology program utilizes smart technology installed in the home to automatically optimize energy use based on the customer's rate plan and during times of very high grid demand.1 Enrollment in this program is facilitated through third-party providers, who may also offer additional incentives at their discretion.1 The Power Saver Rewards Program offers a straightforward way for residential customers to earn a bill credit by simply reducing their energy use on select hot summer days when electricity demand is high.1 This program does not require any special equipment, making it easily accessible to a wide range of customers.1 For customers with air conditioning units, PG&E offers the SmartAC™ program. This involves the installation of a SmartAC switch that allows PG&E to remotely shift some of the air conditioning's energy use out of the hours when demand is at its peak.1 SmartRate™ is an optional rate plan that gives customers more control over their electricity costs while also helping to conserve the power grid when it's most needed. This program is described as risk-free and includes a Bill Protection guarantee.1 Finally, the WatterSaver program focuses on electric water heaters, allowing them to automatically heat water during times when electricity rates are lower. Participants in WatterSaver can earn a $50 gift card as an enrollment bonus and an additional $5 gift card credit for each month of participation.1 It is important to note that, with the exception of the Power Saver Rewards Program and SmartRate which can be combined, customers generally need to choose one energy incentive, energy-reducing, peak hour, or direct bidding program at a time and would need to unenroll from one to join another.1
Business Demand Response Programs: PG&E offers a diverse set of demand response programs tailored to the needs of commercial and industrial customers.1 Peak Day Pricing (PDP) is an optional rate where businesses receive a discount on their regular summer electricity rates in exchange for paying higher prices on designated Peak Day Pricing Event Days, which typically occur on the hottest days of the summer.1 There are usually between nine and fifteen such event days each year.5 The Base Interruptible Program (BIP) is designed to reduce load on PG&E's system when the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) issues a curtailment notice.1 Enrolled customers are required to reduce their load to or below their Firm Service Level (FSL) and receive a monthly incentive based on their potential load reduction. To qualify for BIP, customers must be on a demand time-of-use (TOU) rate schedule and have a maximum demand of at least 100 kW during the summer and winter on-peak periods.5 Participants receive at least 15 or 30 minutes of advance notice before a curtailment event.5 The Capacity Bidding Program (CBP) is an aggregator-managed program that operates from May 1 through October 31 with a Day-Ahead option.1 In this program, third-party aggregators are responsible for designing their own demand response programs, recruiting customers, and managing event alerts.5 Customers must have an interval meter and be on an eligible rate schedule to participate.5 The Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP) is a seven-year pilot program offering financial incentives for businesses to voluntarily reduce their energy use during times of high grid stress and emergencies to help avoid rotating outages.1 This program is administered by PG&E in partnership with Olivine.1 Events are triggered by notices from the CAISO, and participants earn $2 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of load reduction.10 The Optional Binding Mandatory Curtailment (OBMC) Plan is designed to help avoid rotating outages by requiring participating customers to reduce their entire electric circuit load when notified.1 While there are no direct financial incentives for participation, customers who enroll in OBMC are exempt from "block progression" rotating outages. However, there are penalties for failing to meet the specified load reduction.5 Eligibility requires customers to be able to reduce their load by 15% within 15 minutes of an alert.5 Finally, Automated Demand Response (ADR) allows businesses to automate their energy controls to save energy and money.1 This program offers incentives to help offset the start-up costs of implementing automated systems and provides a $200 incentive per kW for approved projects.5 Participation in ADR typically requires enrollment in another PG&E demand response program.5
The array of demand response programs offered by PG&E for both residential and business customers demonstrates a comprehensive strategy to engage various customer segments in managing energy demand. The overlap in some program concepts, such as Peak Day Pricing being available for both residential 1 and business customers 5, suggests a unified approach by PG&E to encourage broad participation in demand response across its service area. Furthermore, the existence of both voluntary programs like ELRP 5 and programs with mandatory aspects like OBMC 5 indicates a recognition of the need for different levels of commitment to ensure grid reliability under varying circumstances. The significant emphasis on automated demand response (ADR) for businesses 5 underscores the growing importance of technology in enabling consistent and reliable demand response from the commercial sector, reducing the operational burden and ensuring quicker responses during grid events.

5. Demand Response Programs by Hetch Hetchy Power:
Hetch Hetchy Power, San Francisco's publicly owned power utility, provides clean electricity to a range of customers, including municipal, residential, and commercial entities.3 While the provided information does not detail specific traditional demand response programs involving short-term load reduction events managed by Hetch Hetchy Power, the utility offers several customer programs focused on energy efficiency and electrification that have implications for managing energy demand.3
Among these programs, the Electric Mobility (E-Mobility) initiatives aim to support the transition to electric transportation, which can influence the timing and amount of electricity demand.3 This includes the EV Charge SF program, which offers financial incentives for installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and the Electrify My Ride: E-Bike Rebate program, providing rebates on the purchase of new e-bikes.3 The All-Electric Multifamily Program assists affordable housing buildings in switching from natural gas to electric systems and appliances.3 This shift towards electrification increases the potential for managing energy demand through future demand flexibility programs. Hetch Hetchy Power Premium offers customers the option to receive 100% renewable electricity 3, aligning with broader clean energy goals but not directly involving demand response. The utility also offers Net Energy Metering (NEM) Programs for customers who have their own distributed generation resources like solar panels.3 These programs manage the flow of electricity between customer sites and the grid and can play a role in broader demand-side management strategies. Energy Efficiency Incentives are available through programs like Blueprint for Savings for large new construction, Modeling for Savings for smaller new construction, and Upgrade for Savings for existing buildings, all aimed at reducing overall energy consumption.3 Additionally, Hetch Hetchy Power implements Municipal Retrofits, undertaking energy efficiency projects in city-owned buildings.3 The Clean Switch Program offers bill credits to new customers who switch their electricity service to Hetch Hetchy Power from PG&E.3 Lastly, GoSolarSF provides incentives for solar installations, although current incentives are primarily focused on low-income customers.3
While Hetch Hetchy Power may not currently feature traditional demand response programs with short-term curtailment events as prominently as PG&E or CleanPowerSF, its strong emphasis on promoting electrification across transportation and building sectors lays a crucial foundation for future demand flexibility initiatives. As San Francisco continues to electrify, the potential to manage the charging of electric vehicles and the operation of electric appliances in response to grid signals will significantly increase. The existing programs are building the necessary infrastructure and customer base to participate in more active demand response programs in the years to come. Furthermore, the availability of Net Energy Metering programs indicates that Hetch Hetchy Power is considering the role of customer-owned distributed energy resources in the broader grid management strategy, which can complement and enhance future demand flexibility efforts.
6. Third-Party Demand Response Providers in San Francisco:
Beyond the programs offered by the main utilities and the community choice aggregator, a significant number of third-party demand response providers operate in San Francisco, offering additional avenues for both residential and commercial customers to participate in demand flexibility.1 These companies contract with utilities or directly participate in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market, providing specialized expertise and often innovative technological solutions.
Voltus is one such provider that pays energy users for reducing or shifting their electricity use in response to signals indicating grid stress, high prices, or high emissions.4 Voltus operates across all nine wholesale power markets in the US and Canada, including CAISO, and offers multiple cash-generating opportunities for energy users in California.4 They work with a wide range of customers, including commercial, industrial, and residential users, providing a platform to track earnings, performance, and the amount of avoided carbon dioxide emissions resulting from their participation.4 Voltus has also formed partnerships with companies like Vurge and Enertiv to help customers maximize the value of their distributed energy resources and identify additional savings opportunities.4 Enel North America is another prominent third-party provider that enables businesses in California to earn money by participating in demand response programs offered by PG&E, Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).9 Enel manages the entire participation process for its clients, from enrollment to dispatch, ensuring they receive the highest possible financial rewards.9 They also provide advanced notification of grid stability issues and install the necessary metering devices at customer facilities to monitor energy consumption in real time.9 Enel offers programs like the Capacity Bidding Program and the Time of Use – Base Interruptible Program.9 Uplight has partnered with PG&E to significantly scale up residential demand response enrollments, reaching over 100,000 customers.22 Uplight focuses on providing a positive user experience, from the initial application process to ongoing participation, including clear and timely communication before, during, and after demand response events.22 Their efforts have contributed to substantial reductions in energy demand during peak events in California.22 Olivine serves as the program partner for PG&E's Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP).10 They manage the enrollment process for businesses interested in participating in ELRP, which offers financial incentives for voluntary load reduction during times of high grid stress.10
The active involvement of these and other third-party aggregators in San Francisco's demand response landscape signifies that demand flexibility is not solely driven by the utilities but also represents a significant market opportunity for specialized energy service companies. These aggregators bring valuable expertise in aggregating demand, managing customer participation, and navigating the complexities of the energy markets, offering tailored solutions and potentially enhanced incentives for customers. The partnerships between utilities like PG&E and third-party providers such as Uplight highlight a collaborative strategy to expand the reach and effectiveness of demand response programs, leveraging the strengths of both types of organizations to achieve broader participation and greater overall demand reduction.
7. Regulatory Landscape and Initiatives:
The demand flexibility landscape in San Francisco is significantly shaped by the regulatory oversight and proactive initiatives of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy Commission (CEC).6 Both agencies recognize the critical role of demand response in ensuring grid reliability, integrating renewable energy resources, and achieving the state's ambitious clean energy goals.
The CPUC provides a broad definition of demand response as reductions, increases, or shifts in electricity consumption by customers in response to economic or reliability signals, with the aim of maximizing ratepayer benefits.8 The commission oversees the administration of demand response programs by investor-owned utilities (IOUs) like PG&E, Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) such as CleanPowerSF, and third-party commercial entities.8 Notably, the CPUC established the Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP) to pilot a new demand response approach aimed at avoiding rotating outages during periods of peak demand.23 Recognizing the importance of aligning demand response with retail rate structures, the CPUC opened Rulemaking 22-07-005 to advance demand flexibility through electric rates.7 A key focus of this rulemaking is to resolve the "chicken-and-egg" problem where widespread adoption of flexible demand management solutions requires both inexpensive automation technologies and robust, standardized, and easy-to-implement policy pathways integrated into retail rates.7
The CEC is also actively involved in promoting and improving load flexibility as a crucial element of California's transition to a 100% clean energy grid.6 The commission supports the Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) Program, which incentivizes customer load reduction and backup generation to support the state's electrical grid during extreme events.6 Furthermore, the CEC administers the Virtual Power Plant Approaches for Demand Flexibility (VPP-FLEX) grant program, which funds demonstrations of community-based virtual power plant approaches and innovative energy management systems in commercial buildings to increase demand flexibility.26 The CEC is also developing Load Management Standards designed to help integrate renewable energy on the grid by aligning electricity use with generation and grid capacity, utilizing energy storage and other flexible resources.6 These standards aim to improve air quality, mitigate climate change, and put downward pressure on electric rates by encouraging consumers to shift their energy use to times when clean electricity is more available and affordable.27
The CPUC's emphasis on the interaction between demand response and retail rate design highlights the fundamental role that appropriate pricing signals and financial incentives play in motivating customer participation in demand flexibility programs. The CEC's proactive approach through initiatives like the DSGS program and the development of Load Management Standards demonstrates a commitment to integrating demand flexibility into the core of the state's energy planning and operations, particularly as the penetration of renewable energy continues to increase. The VPP-FLEX grant program further underscores the growing interest in exploring innovative mechanisms like virtual power plants to aggregate the demand response capabilities of distributed energy resources, signaling a forward-looking approach to grid management in California.
8. Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program in San Francisco:
While distinct from electricity demand flexibility, San Francisco also implements a comprehensive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program aimed at reducing the demand for single-occupancy vehicle travel, thereby impacting overall energy consumption and traffic congestion within the city.28 The primary goal of the TDM Program is to decrease the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) generated by new development projects in San Francisco.28
The TDM Program achieves this by mandating a series of development-focused measures designed to shift travel patterns to and from new buildings.28 Examples of these measures include "unbundling" parking costs from lease costs, providing ample bicycle parking and amenities, offering subsidized public transit passes, and facilitating access to carshare and vanpool programs.28 The program applies to new residential developments with at least 10 dwelling units or bedrooms and new commercial developments spanning 10,000 square feet or more.28 While the program sets mandatory standards that eligible buildings must meet, it is also designed to be flexible, allowing project sponsors or property owners to choose the most feasible ways to meet these requirements based on the specific circumstances of their projects.28 The effectiveness of the TDM Program is evaluated by tracking changes in solo driving rates, measured by single occupancy vehicle (SOV) trips, as well as other key metrics such as overall VMT and greenhouse gas emissions.28
The success of the TDM program, particularly the active participation of developers driven by the economic incentive of gaining timely project approvals, underscores the importance of aligning demand management goals with the existing motivations of key stakeholders. The program's integration with the city's development approval process has proven to be an effective strategy for encouraging the adoption of TDM measures. Furthermore, the TDM program's focus on measuring specific outcomes like reduced VMT and shifts in travel mode share provides a valuable framework for evaluating the effectiveness of demand management initiatives in general, a model that could be adapted and applied to electricity demand flexibility programs as well.
9. Effectiveness and Benefits of Demand Flexibility Programs:
The implementation of demand flexibility programs in San Francisco yields a multitude of benefits, contributing significantly to a more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy system. These programs enhance grid reliability by reducing peak electricity demand, thereby lessening the strain on the system and minimizing the risk of power outages.1 From an economic perspective, demand flexibility helps avoid the construction of new, often expensive, power plants and transmission infrastructure that would primarily be used to meet occasional peak demand.8 This ultimately contributes to a lower overall cost of electricity for all ratepayers.8 Moreover, by reducing the need to rely on high-priced energy sources during peak times, demand flexibility can further lower energy costs.8 Environmentally, these programs are crucial as they decrease the consumption of fossil fuels, which are often used to meet peak demand, leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality.1 Demand flexibility also plays a vital role in facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid by providing a mechanism to balance the variable nature of solar and wind power.8 Importantly, participation in demand flexibility programs offers direct benefits to consumers, providing opportunities to save money on their energy bills or even earn revenue through incentives.1
Evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in San Francisco can be seen in the results achieved by various initiatives. For example, Uplight's partnership with PG&E reportedly contributed to a significant 1.21-gigawatt decrease in electricity demand during a period of all-time high demand on the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) grid.22 Similarly, CleanPowerSF's Peak Day Partners program has demonstrated increasing success, achieving a record-breaking 97,664 kWh of energy load reduction in the 2024 season through the participation of large downtown San Francisco buildings.13 These examples highlight the real and substantial impact that demand flexibility programs can have on managing electricity demand in the city. Despite these successes, research from Berkeley Lab indicates a need for more comprehensive and publicly available data on the outcomes of demand flexibility programs across the United States.29 This lack of standardized reporting can hinder a thorough evaluation of program effectiveness and the identification of best practices. Furthermore, studies suggest that residential customer engagement in demand response programs can decline over time, indicating a need for ongoing efforts to maintain participation.30 The complexity of program designs and the intricacies of rate structures can also act as barriers to wider customer participation, suggesting that simplification and clearer communication are essential.31
The documented instances of significant demand reduction through programs like Uplight's and CleanPowerSF's underscore the practical and considerable impact of demand flexibility initiatives on San Francisco's grid stability. However, the identified need for more comprehensive and standardized data on program outcomes highlights a crucial area for improvement in order to better assess and optimize the design and implementation of these programs. Additionally, the challenges related to customer engagement and program complexity suggest that continued efforts to simplify participation and enhance awareness of the benefits are necessary to maximize the potential of demand flexibility in the city.
10. Conclusion and Recommendations:
San Francisco exhibits a dynamic and diverse landscape of demand flexibility programs, offered by a range of entities including the primary utility, the community choice aggregator, and numerous third-party providers.
