6Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureForeword
We stand at a pivotal moment in the global energy transition. The convergence
of decentralisation, digitalisation, and surging demand is reshaping the energy
landscape, presenting unprecedented opportunities alongside formidable chal-
lenges. At the heart of this transformation lies the need to seamlessly manage
three critical flows: information, energy, and transactions across a decentralised
and diverse ecosystem. Addressing these challenges requires more than just
advanced physical infrastructure—it demands a unified, interoperable frame-
work that integrates data, resources, and stakeholders. This is where the vision
of the Digital Energy Grid (DEG) becomes truly transformative.
DEG envisions a future where universal digital building blocks—identity,
machine-readable data, and verifiable transactions—create an interoperable
backbone for the energy ecosystem. By digitising assets, participants, and
transactions, DEG addresses systemic inefficiencies, reduces transactional
frictions, and unlocks cascading benefits across industries. This approach
moves beyond isolated solutions, embracing a shared, scalable framework that
can trigger a flywheel effect of innovation and combinatorial value.
One of the most exciting aspects of the DEG is its potential to enable symbi-
otic relationships between energy and technology. Take, for instance, the syn-
ergy between DEG and Artificial Intelligence (AI). By harmonising fragmented
data streams and enabling transaction-ready datasets, DEG enhances AI’s
contextual intelligence, driving superior strategic insights and real-time deci-
sion-making. In turn, AI amplifies DEG’s potential, enabling adaptive energy
management, precise demand forecasting, and dynamic grid optimisation.
Together, they can establish a dynamic, agentic energy ecosystem where
AI-driven systems autonomously optimise supply-demand equilibria, enable
real-time market transactions, and seamlessly integrate information, energy,
and financial flows at scale.
This paper marks a significant step toward realising this vision in collaboration
with the International Energy Agency (IEA), an organisation at the forefront of
global energy cooperation. The IEA’s leadership in fostering international col-
laboration and bringing together diverse perspectives is pivotal to navigating
the complexities of the energy transition. Their involvement underscores the
importance of a coordinated, global approach to building the energy systems
of the future.
However, realising this vision will require collective action. I invite stakeholders
across the energy ecosystem—governments, industries, innovators, and com-
munities—to join us in shaping this transformative future. Together, we can build
a Digital Energy Grid that not only addresses the challenges of today but also
lays the foundation for a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive energy future.
The time to act is now!

7Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureDigitalisation is a key trend across our economies and the energy sector is no
exception: vast quantities of data are gathered, interpreted and acted upon
every day to manage the increasing complexity of energy markets.
In our 2024 World Energy Outlook we showed that the world is entering into
the Age of Electricity, as this unique “fuel” plays an increasingly crucial role in
all economies in the world. Demand for electricity is set to grow six times faster
than overall energy demand to 2035. This is due partly to traditional uses like
air conditioning and industrial motors, but also to new sectors such as electric
vehicles and data centres.
One aspect the Age of Electricity is the growth of cost competitive renewable
sources of electricity generation. In 2024, 80% of global capacity additions of
electricity generation capacity came from low-emissions sources, and solar
PV is leading the way. In 2024, the world added so much solar PV capacity that
the output from new installations in this year alone could power the entire
country of Korea. At the same time, generation from the world’s nuclear reac-
tors is on track to reach new heights in 2025.
These trends create huge opportunities to deliver the energy people need,
more efficiently, affordably and productively, but also with lower emissions. But
it also creates challenges.
One of these is balancing an increasingly variable, decentralised and digitalised
electricity grid. IEA analysis shows that the demand for electricity system flex-
ibility, or the ability of the electricity system to adjust supply and demand to
ensure they always match, will increase by 2.5 times in Europe to 2035. Meeting
this will require flexibility from all parts of the system, with a growing contribu-
tion from the smart combination of battery storage and demand response.
This will require facilitating the ability of system operators to communicate
with millions, indeed billions, of distributed devices, from behind-the-meter
battery storage to electric vehicles to air conditioning units. It will necessitate
flows of data, new markets, and new incentives.
At the IEA, we have always welcomed big new ideas. We need them to solve
the challenges we face and realise the opportunities ahead. FIDE’s idea of a
“Digital Energy Grid” – an overarching digital framework that facilitates more
interconnectivity between energy assets – is an example. FIDE’s work – includ-
ing this new report, to which the IEA is pleased to have contributed – provides
thought leadership about how we can design the long-term frameworks to rise
to these changes. Bringing these perspectives together is key to find solutions.

8Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureThe global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by
decentralisation, digitalisation, and surging demand from electrification and
economic growth. These shifts are reshaping how energy is produced, distrib-
uted, and consumed, presenting both unprecedented opportunities and com-
plex challenges.
By 2035, nearly 3668 GW of rooftop solar PV is expected to be installed glob-
ally—a staggering 429% increase from today1
. This expansion underscores the
promise of decentralized renewables but also highlights the difficulty of man-
aging distributed and variable resources. Global electricity demand is projected
to nearly double by 20502 under current policies and could rise even further
under more ambitious scenarios. Key contributors include the electrification
of heating, transport, industrial processes and increased energy demands from
data centres. Emerging markets and developing economies are expected to
drive nearly 80% of this growth by 20303
.
This rapid demand growth and the proliferation of distributed energy resources
(DERs) expose the urgent need for better coordination across the energy
ecosystem. Technologies such as heat pumps and air conditioners are
increasing demand sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, while extreme
weather events like heatwaves place additional strain on power systems.
Electrification is also altering hourly demand patterns, with peak demand rising
faster than average demand in many locations —requiring significant investment
in grid infrastructure.
While policy-driven, market-based, and technological solutions exist to address
these challenges, many are purpose-specific, targeting isolated issues rather
than systemic needs. Current solutions, often fragmented and non-interoper-
able impede the seamless integration of resources and stakeholders. For
instance, limited grid visibility complicates the integration of variable renewables
and DERs. Furthermore, the reliance on non-digital modes of operation exac-
erbates these challenges. Many processes lack portable, verifiable digital records,
leading to information asymmetry and trust issues. Physical certifications for
equipment that cannot be digitally verified and energy transactions without
digital records hinder transparency, increase costs, and limit coordination.
These fragmented and non-digital practices leave the ecosystem ill-equipped
to adapt to the complexities of the energy transition.
Digital solutions hold immense potential to facilitate a smooth energy transition,
yet their impact is diminished when developed in silos. The energy ecosystem
faces three interconnected coordination challenges of managing information
flows, energy flows, and transaction flows seamlessly - all in a more decen-
tralised energy systems of the future.
Executive summary
9Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureAddressing these challenges requires more than advanced physical infrastruc-
ture—it demands robust frameworks for sharing critical data such as demand,
supply, and pricing signals. Advancements in smart devices, data analytics, and
AI-based forecasting offer new opportunities, but physical energy systems
remain constrained by technical, financial, and infrastructural limitations.
The true challenge lies in synchronising the flow of information with the phys-
ical flow of energy across diverse stakeholders and distributed resources.
A transformative solution lies in adopting an infrastructure-led approach:
establishing a foundational digital infrastructure that moves beyond piecemeal
solutions to embrace a shared, scalable framework. This concept can be envi-
sioned as a data-grid to augment the physical energy grid, designed to handle
the complexity and variability of modern energy markets.
At the heart of this approach is the vision for the Digital Energy Grid (DEG)
that unifies the energy ecosystem through universal digital building blocks.
DEG introduces key principles such as universal identity, machine readability,
and verifiability, creating a composable, programmable, and portable digital
infrastructure. By digitising transactions, assets, and participants in an interop-
erable manner across the value chain, DEG creates a digital backbone of the
energy ecosystem that enhances transparency, reliability, and adaptability.
For example, DEG assigns universal identities to energy resources
and actors, akin to phone numbers or postal codes, ensuring global
uniqueness. It enables machine readability by digitising essential
metadata such as energy ratings and certifications, enhancing
efficiency and interoperability. Through cryptographic verifiability,
DEG ensures tamper-proof digital records, fostering trust while
preserving data privacy and sovereignty.
These capabilities unlock systemic benefits: composability, programmability,
and portability of assets and data. DEG integrates core functionalities like
observability and secure transactions into the infrastructure, aligning the phys-
ical flow of energy with digital information and transaction flows. This approach
facilitates innovation and collaboration at scale, streamlining progress toward
shared energy goals.
10Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureMuch like a road network enables trade across regions,
DEG envisions a digital network that seamlessly
coordinates energy, data, and value. This unified
approach potentially addresses systemic inefficiencies,
reduces transaction frictions, and unlocks cascading
benefits essential for a sustainable energy transition.
DEG is not a product or standalone technology but a vision for an interopera-
ble, scalable, and modular digital infrastructure. It complements existing systems,
bridging legacy standards while enabling future advancements. By reducing
fragmentation and fostering a cohesive framework, DEG creates conditions for
private innovation and public policy to co-evolve.
The Digital Energy Grid offers a critical pathway to energy system transformation—
unifying purpose-specific innovations into a cohesive energy future capable
of addressing both anticipated and unforeseen challenges of the transition.

12Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureThe energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the
convergence of decentralization, digitalization, and rising demand fueled by
electrification and economic growth. This shift presents vast opportunities
alongside critical challenges, including managing distributed and variable
resources, rising peak demand, and the integration of climate-sensitive tech-
nologies like heat pumps. Addressing these complexities demands a coordinated,
infrastructure-led approach centered on a scalable digital energy grid.
This paper presents a vision for a unified energy ecosystem capable of
addressing the structural barriers and coordination gaps that currently impede
progress in the energy sector. It first explores why the current energy system
remains fragmented and fails to scale to the levels necessary for a sustainable
future. It examines the limitations of existing solutions and the systemic bar-
riers to progress. Next, the paper introduces an infrastructure-led approach
as a compelling alternative to isolated solutions. This paradigm shift toward
infrastructural thinking underpins the foundation of the Digital Energy Grid
(DEG). The paper explores the specifics of DEG—what it is, what it is not, and
the transformative possibilities it unlocks for the energy ecosystem of tomor-
row. Finally, it outlines how DEG can be implemented at a high level.
The paper presents a vision, not a definitive solution, aiming to spur global
dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders to advance this approach,
amplify ongoing efforts, and progress toward a unified architecture for a more
efficient, sustainable, and equitable energy ecosystem.
Introduction
01
We are in the middle of
one of the biggest energy
transformations in history
14Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureThe global energy landscape is undergoing one of the most profound trans-
formations in history. This is driven by an urgent need for decarbonization, rapid
growth in energy demand, and breakthroughs in technology that are changing
how electricity is produced, distributed, and consumed.
An estimated 748.5 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity4 ,
a reminder of the challenges facing today’s energy sector: ensuring universal
access while pursuing a secure, resilient, and sustainable energy future.
Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach—signif-
icant investments in physical grid infrastructure to extend access to under-
served regions, along with the deployment of clean energy systems such as
renewables to expand generation capacity in a sustainable way. A future-ready
energy infrastructure becomes essential to support this increasingly decen-
tralized landscape.
1.1
Energy demand is soaring with electrification,
economic growth, heating and cooling needs.
Meeting this growing demand sustainably is
a challenge that highlights the need for
greater efficiency
Recent data show that over the past decade, global energy demand increased
at an average rate of 1.4% per year, with emerging economies hitting rates as
high as 2.56%. Global electricity demand growth in 2024 was forecast to reach
4.2%, among the highest levels in the past two decades. Under current policies,
electricity demand could nearly double by 2050, with more ambitious policy
scenarios likely driving it higher still 5
. Various forces contribute to this increase,
including the electrification of heating, transport, and industrial processes,
rising demand from data centers, and a higher prevalence of household appli-
ances. Although renewables continue to grow their share of the electricity mix,
the pace must accelerate substantially to meet international climate targets
and still ensure reliable, affordable, and secure electricity access—especially
in low- and middle-income countries.
Electric mobility is a major driver reshaping electricity usage. The market share
of electric vehicles (battery electric and plug-in hybrids) was expected to be
around 20.9% of global sales in 2024 and could climb to 43.4% by 2030. By
then, nearly one in six cars in the global fleet is projected to be electric, with a
Electrification of vehicles
15Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructurecombined potential energy storage capacity of over 16 TWh— equivalent to over
six times the global BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) capacity of 2.46 TWh
in 20306. Although EVs raise power demand, they also offer flexibility: with vehi-
cle-to-grid (V2G) technologies, individual owners can supply stored battery
energy back to the grid during peak times if robust energy management systems
are in place.
The year 2024 marked the hottest on record—the first time the world crossed
the 1.5-degree threshold, with the global average temperature hitting 1.6 degrees
above pre-industrial levels7. As incomes rise and heatwaves and extreme weather
become more frequent, electricity demand for cooling is set to surge, turning
air-conditioning from a luxury into a necessity for millions. Residential demand
for space cooling could more than triple by 2050 under current policy sce-
narios. By 2030, the global air-conditioner stock is likely to exceed 2.1 billion
units, a 36.8% climb from today. Heat pump adoption is also on the rise, with
their share in residential heating equipment sales expected to reach 22% by
2030, for a total capacity of 1.88 TW8. All this underscores how weather-driven
loads are increasingly shaping electricity demand patterns.
Increasing heating and cooling needs
The energy demands of data centers are evolving alongside advancements in
AI. While training AI models has historically driven exponential growth in com-
putational power—doubling roughly every five to six months since 20109 —recent
innovations, such as more comprehensive architectures and new inference
techniques, suggest that this trend may not be linear. Nevertheless, large-scale
data centers continue to consume vast amounts of electricity, sometimes
equivalent to that of 100,000 households10
. While global data centers account
for around 1% of total electricity consumption11
, the load can be heavily con-
centrated regionally. In Virginia, for instance, data centers already account for
over a quarter of the state’s total electricity consumption12
. Technology com-
panies often aim to power these facilities with renewables, making them some
of the largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy—but that requires
accurate, timely information on grid capacity and permitting rules. As data
centers expand rapidly, planners face the possibility that renewable capacity
may not keep pace with new demand, raising the risk of local or even regional
energy shortages. This dynamic brings new urgency to the need for coordina-
tion across infrastructure, finance, and policy to secure adequate, sustainable
electricity supplies.
Data centers
16Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureOne of the most important developments is the increase in variable sources of
renewable electricity generation, especially from solar PV and wind. Generation
from solar PV and wind combined is projected to nearly triple between 2023
and 2030 under current policy trends, with solar PV alone driving roughly 80%
of that capacity growth. In 2023, fossil fuels constituted 60.1% of global elec-
tricity supply, typically from centralized thermal power plants, but that share is
projected to decline to 44% by 2030. Over the same period, capacity additions
in solar PV and wind are forecast to contribute over 90% of the net increase in
electricity supply, pointing to a marked shift in the global power mix. By 2030,
wind and solar together are expected to comprise about 30.6% of global elec-
tricity supply and substantially higher proportions in certain key markets—44.1%
in Europe, 24.4% in India, 38.5% in China, and 34.5% in the United States13
.

17Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureWithin the trend of variable renewables, distributed energy technologies like
rooftop solar PV and community wind projects are growing in importance. As
of today, installed global solar PV capacity stands at about 1,610 GW, with roughly
43.1% as rooftop solar. By 2035, total rooftop and utility-scale solar PV installations
could increase by over five times, pushing rooftop solar specifically to around
3,700 GW—an enormous 429% jump from current levels15
. Distributed energy
resources (DERs) bring generation closer to load centers, reducing transmission
losses while enhancing grid resilience. Yet managing widespread, small-scale,
and intermittent sources poses operational and regulatory challenges across
many parts of the world.
Energy storage is proving pivotal for integrating higher shares of renewables,
helping to smooth out intermittency. While pumped hydro and other forms of
energy storage remain significant, battery energy storage systems (BESS) are
expected to account for 90% of the growth in storage capacity in the coming
years16
. Battery storage capacity is projected to increase nearly tenfold from
88.8 GW in 2023 to over 850 GW, with the average duration increasing from
around two hours today to nearly three hours in 2030. Approximately 38% of
current BESS capacity—about 33 GW—operates behind the meter (for exam-
ple, in homes and businesses). By 2030, the total behind-the-metre BESS
power capacity is expected to grow more than fivefold to nearly 180 GW, with
over half of this capacity in China. Utility-scale batteries could increase by over
twelvefold, from 55.1 GW now to more than 675.3 GW by 203017. These trends
reinforce that DERs and battery innovations can bring major benefits in resil-
ience and adaptability for a low-carbon transition.
Increasing use of distributed technologies
Digital technologies—smart meters, demand-response-enabling appliances,
and IoT-based controls—are multiplying, making it possible to engage end users
in grid operations in ways previously unthinkable. Tools such as Grid Orches-
tration Software, Network Modelling, and Distributed Energy Resource Man-
agement Systems (DERMS) enable real-time monitoring and grid flexibility,
supporting renewable integration especially in high-income countries. By 2022,
the number of smart power meters worldwide surpassed one billion, a tenfold
jump from 2010. Meanwhile, connected devices with automated controls and
sensors are expected to reach 13 billion in 2023, up from fewer than 1 billion a
decade ago18 . Early examples include peer-to-peer energy trading pilots in
Australia19 and solar buy-back schemes in parts of the United States 20
, which
allow consumers to transact at micro scales. As these approaches expand,
dynamic pricing is likely to become more prevalent, potentially boosting the
responsiveness of end users.
Demand response and grid management
enabled by digitalization
18Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureAmid the growth of DERs, energy transactions are becoming more frequent,
smaller in value, increasingly time-sensitive, and bidirectional. Where consump-
tion used to be largely passive and predictable, consumers in some regions
now actively participate in flexible demand programs or generate surplus power
with rooftop solar. Traditional grid setups are not yet fully prepared for this
shift, reinforcing the need for modern, interoperable systems.i. Static, mega, uni-directionalii. Dynamic, micro, bi-directional

There is a trend towards higher volume,
more micro-value, dynamic and bi-directional
transactions in the energy market, underscoring
the need to modernise the gridFigure 2. Micro, bidirectional transactions are redefining
the future of inclusive, high-volume energy exchanges.
19Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureMounting pressure on today’s grids manifest in several ways –
Power outages
Negative energy prices and curtailment
Grid congestion
Regions from Latin America to South Asia, Europe, and North America have
experienced severe blackouts of increasing frequency and duration, revealing
vulnerabilities in adapting to extreme weather and crises. Unreliable forecast-
ing and inflexible response can drive unexpected price spikes and widespread
disruptions. These outages cost around $100 billion each year—about 0.1% of
global GDP21
.
Simultaneously, the rise of renewables has introduced a new challenge: neg-
ative energy prices. In 2024, the share of negative priced hours in Southern
California exceeded 20% marking a more than threefold increase compared
to the previous year 22 . This issue is compounded when renewable producers
are compensated to curtail output – a stopgap that is financially and envi-
ronmentally inefficient compared to encouraging flexible-demand response
and storage solutions.
Delays in connecting new renewable projects and updating grid infrastructure
are emerging as critical barriers. In Germany, congestion management costs
exceeded EUR 4 billion in 2022—funds that are equivalent to investing in about
4.5 gigawatts (GW) of new solar PV capacity. In the United States, transmission
grid congestion costs ballooned from USD 6 billion in 2019 to nearly USD 21
billion in 2022. Britain spent nearly GBP 1 billion just for balancing actions in
winter 2021–2022 in response to transmission constraints 23
. Such challenges,
if left unresolved, could hamper both energy security and climate aspirations.
Rising incidents and growing financial impacts underline the need for more
flexible supply and demand capabilities. However, a mix of technical, economic,
and informational constraints often blocks new market designs and frameworks
that might offer solutions.
1.4
Infrastructure strain - Blackouts, negative pricing,
and interconnection bottlenecks
20Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureAs demand variability increases and both DERs and variable renewables multiply,
more integrated coordination is key to maintaining grid stability. Electrification—
driven by heat pumps, air conditioners, electric vehicles—shapes new load
curves and makes them more susceptible to short-term or seasonal disruptions,
especially during heatwaves.
Despite significant progress, the pace of transformation falls
short of meeting global climate goals—like the international
objective to triple renewables by 2030.

21Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureAddressing these complexities requires greater system flexibility, both short-
term and seasonal. Battery storage is becoming a crucial short-term dispatch-
able resource for managing intermittency, and demand-side measures can
help reshape load patterns, shifting peak demand to periods of abundant
renewable generation. Yet these solutions rely on a supportive market design,
broader grid upgrades, and digital frameworks that link supply, demand, and
storage seamlessly.
Digital technologies like smart meters and demand-response systems can
reshape consumption, moving peak loads from evening hours to midday solar
production. Nonetheless, it will take clear policies and pricing signals to make
such solutions ubiquitous. A unified, cross-sector effort—integrating technical
innovation, market-based mechanisms, and regulatory coordination—remains
vital to building a resilient, secure system that also meets mounting energy
and climate goals.
1.6
Augmenting grid infrastructure
to handle digital complexity
Decentralization, digitalization, and the growing dynamism of the energy system
pose both a defining challenge and a major opportunity for the coming decades.
Harnessing these changes will require new market designs and coordination
across diverse assets, including batteries, flexible loads, and dispatchable
generation. Digital tools and software-based systems can foster real-time
orchestration of distributed resources, but only if stakeholders can share data
easily and trust the platforms they use.
A unified approach to policy, grid planning, and technological advancement
can help us reach a sustainable energy system that supports rising demand
while staying on track for climate and security goals. In the next chapter, we
will see how structural barriers and a lack of coordination prevent us from fully
leveraging these innovations—and why a foundational digital infrastructure may
hold the key to overcoming them.

23Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureThe ongoing global energy transition is characterized by massive shifts toward
electrification, decentralization, and digitalization. While these advances prom-
ise cleaner, more resilient, and more equitable energy systems, they also bring
fresh challenges. Power grids are no longer linear, top-down structures that simply
deliver electricity from a few central generators to passive consumers. Instead,
they are evolving into complex, interactive networks composed of large-scale
renewables, distributed energy resources (DERs), smart appliances, and numer-
ous new participants capable of generating, storing, or trading electricity.
To fully unlock the potential of this transition, it is essential to understand the
structural barriers that hinder progress, recognize the resulting coordination
challenges, and explore new ways to overcome these obstacles through inno-
vative thinking.
2.1
Structural barriers in
the ecosystem today
Current solutions are purpose-specific
Current solutions occur in silos (non-interoperable)
Non-digital modes of operation
Many of the existing solutions address only a narrow aspect of the energy
ecosystem. For example, there are platforms dedicated solely to EV charging
or tools designed exclusively for DER management. Although these solutions
can be effective within their limited scope, they do not provide a comprehen-
sive framework that supports the full range of energy needs. This narrow focus
means that promising innovations may only solve a single piece of the puzzle
without contributing to an integrated system.
Often, systems and technologies operate independently without sharing data
or communicating with one another. This siloed approach leaves vital information
isolated. For instance, data captured by one system may not be compatible with
that from another, resulting in a fragmented landscape where opportunities for
synergy are missed. Without interoperability, the full benefits of digitalization
remain out of reach, and efforts to integrate new solutions are stymied.
A significant portion of current processes still relies on manual or paper-based
methods. These non-digital approaches lead to higher transaction costs, con-
24Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructuretribute to information asymmetry, and reduce trust among stakeholders. When
contracts and performance metrics must be verified through physical inspec-
tions rather than automated digital records, the process becomes both
time-consuming and prone to error. Such legacy practices further complicate
the scaling of innovative digital solutions.
These barriers give rise to three interrelated coordination challenges –
The absence of unified digital records means that data is often fragmented
and inconsistent. Even in advanced economies with millions of smart meters,
critical information—such as the timing and volume of energy production, con-
sumption, and trade—remains scattered across disparate systems. This infor-
mation asymmetry hampers real-time decision-making by grid operators,
regulators, and market participants, sometimes leading to inaccurate load
forecasts and delayed dispatch of energy.
The reliance on manual processes and redundant documentation increases
transaction costs. Without standardized digital records, establishing trust
becomes challenging—especially when traditional verification methods (such
as repeated physical inspections or manual audits) are too slow or resource-in-
tensive. This low trust hinders market participation and delays the onboarding
of new players.
Energy transactions are burdened by high costs, unstandardised processes, and
limited access to low cost, dynamic, and rapid contracting mechanisms between
transacting parties. Participants, such as battery owners or demand-response
providers, often lack the infrastructure to independently initiate trustworthy
contracts or build reputational scores. Costly digital linkages and intensive con-
tract management further increase transaction costs, restricting the ability of
individuals and small-scale energy providers to participate in energy markets
without local aggregators. The absence of cohesive frameworks limits the market
potential of DERs. For instance, only 25% of solar installations in the U.S. include
a battery, despite the increasing availability of these technologies26

Implications of these
structural barriers
25Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureWithout an integrated digital system to coordinate the physical movement
of energy, inefficiencies and imbalances arise. These issues can lead to reduced
grid stability and diminish confidence in the system’s ability to handle variable
renewable inputs and distributed resources effectively. Even well-designed
demand-response programs may fall short if energy flows remain poorly
coordinated.
Addressing these structural barriers calls for an approach that sees beyond
individual projects or quick-fix policies. The concept of infrastructure-thinking
with a unified approach, grounded in shared and scalable digital infrastructure,
enables the energy system to move beyond piecemeal efforts and tackle the
underlying lack of coordination. It is not about pushing a singular technology
or enforcing a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, it involves ensuring that minimal,
open standards and protocols allow diverse actors to interconnect, share
trustworthy data, and transact with reduced friction. Historical examples, such
as the standardization of telephone networks, the open protocols of the internet,
and uniform electrical systems, demonstrate how unification can revolutionize
entire sectors.
Drawing parallels from past successes, the energy sector could adopt shared
digital “rails” that facilitate interoperability among devices, networks, and admin-
istrative systems. This is seen via multiple past innovations like Pix in Brazil and
UPI in India (see annexure). This approach creates a dynamic, scalable ecosys-
tem in which new standards, tools, and security methods can be incorporated
without fracturing legacy systems. It establishes a cohesive digital layer that
invites every participant—from an off-grid micro-hydro unit to a cutting-edge
AI-driven aggregator—to interconnect at the minimal required level and speak
a common digital language. Through “programmable contracts,” for instance,
rules can be executed automatically once predefined conditions are met. For
example, paying a homeowner when their rooftop solar sends surplus power to
a neighbor’s battery. These mechanisms unlock new business models, from
peer-to-peer energy markets to aggregated demand-response programs, where
each participant has confidence in the integrity of the data, processes, and
settlements involved.
Historically, technological innovation has scaled through unification and infra-
structure thinking, with purpose-specific advancements converging into broader,
purpose-generic solutions. Minimal, standardized “packetization” of design and
processes through open specifications has fueled rapid growth across indus-
tries—a pattern that could similarly drive efficiency, resilience, and sustainabil-
ity in the energy sector.

27Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureWith a unified energy environment in place, the energy ecosystem can trans-
form from a patchwork of purpose-specific, siloed solutions into an integrated
network that supports robust cross-sector collaboration and innovation. This
transformation can reduce friction, enhance trust, and ultimately help the sector
meet accelerating demand, manage variable renewable inputs, and overcome
unpredictable challenges.
In short, the energy sector already has numerous promising pilots, frameworks,
and technologies. What it lacks is a unifying structure to weave these efforts
into a resilient, scalable fabric capable of meeting accelerating demand, vari-
able renewables, and unpredictable shocks. The next chapter outlines how an
infrastructure-led approach—embodied by the concept of the Digital Energy
Grid—can shift us out of siloed thinking and into coordinated action, setting
the stage for a new era of reliable, dynamic, and inclusive energy systems.

energy transition and security
Digital Energy Grid (DEG)

energy grid and embody
infrastructure-thinking
03
29Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureThe energy system grows more complex each day. Siloed fixes—ranging from
specialized software platforms to targeted policy incentives—do help in par-
ticular niches, but they frequently lack the broader coordination required to
address a system where everything from rooftop solar generation to demand-re-
sponse programs must align. This is a problem because the next phase of the
energy transition depends on integrating a growing number of technologies
and participants into a unified whole. A grid that only partially sees behind-
the-meter resources or that requires manual verification of countless small
transactions is unlikely to keep pace with the demands of higher renewable
penetration and more electrified end uses.
Infrastructure-thinking has guided the evolution of railways, telecommunica-
tions, the Internet, and digital financial services by establishing minimal yet
robust common layers. These layers made entire ecosystems flourish. In the
energy realm, the creation of a shared “digital architecture”—one that binds
physical infrastructure with real-time data, economic transactions, and regu-
latory oversight—may present an equally transformative opportunity. Such an
architecture can help the grid handle new inflection points by systematically
knitting together the various participants, resources, and solutions under an
overarching, interoperable framework.
This paper introduces the Digital Energy Grid (DEG) as a conceptual blueprint
for building a unified energy ecosystem. The guiding principle is to interlink the
physical grid—comprising generation, distribution, loads and storage assets—
with a digital “data grid” that encompasses everything from pricing signals to
device identities and transaction histories. With that arrangement, we can shift
from a traditional top-down network to a more adaptable, network-of-networks
model, where each node (be it a microgrid, an aggregator’s platform, or a pro-
sumer’s smart home) remains autonomous yet still interoperable with the rest.
By weaving together real-time data streams, operational signals, and secure
exchange mechanisms, DEG sets the stage for a resilient, transparent, and
innovation-friendly infrastructure. It raises the “playground” for diverse partic-
ipants—utilities, regulators, communities, startups, large industries—fostering
a more cohesive approach to shared goals like decarbonization, reliability, &
affordability.
3.1
A vision for a
unified energy future
30Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureUniversal and interoperable identity
for all energy assets and actors
The first cornerstone is establishing digital identities for each entity, actor and
asset—ranging from power plants, transmission grids, and commercial battery
farms to smaller devices like rooftop panels, electric vehicle (EV) batteries, or
building automation systems. These identities act as globally unique references,
akin to phone numbers or IP addresses in telecommunications.
i.
The Digital Energy Grid (DEG) centers on three interrelated elements that, when
combined, enable seamless interoperability, scalability, and reliability.
Machine-readable data formats
Beyond simple tagging, DEG insists that metadata—about devices, energy
transactions, certifications, or consumption profiles—be expressed in a way
that can be systematically processed by software. Instead of static documents
or PDFs, the focus shifts toward open, machine-readable templates.
ii.
3.2
Key building blocks of
the Digital Energy Grid
Country codes for telephone numbers and zip codes
Each country may have its own standards for telephone numbers and zip
codes, often leading to duplicates or non-interoperable formats across
borders. However, the introduction of standardized prefixes, such as country
codes for phone numbers (e.g., +91 for India), ensures unique identification
and seamless global communication. Similarly, zip codes, while locally
defined, rely on hierarchical structures that allow for clear and consistent
mapping within broader postal systems. These simple yet effective
standardizations demonstrate how unique identifiers can bridge regional
inconsistencies, enabling global addressability and interoperability.
31Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureBy layering digital identity, data interoperability, and trust mechanisms over the
existing physical grid, DEG transforms today’s somewhat siloed landscape into
a more interconnected “network of networks.” In practical terms, it means that:
• Transmission and Distribution Operators can have real-time, programmable
access to each distributed asset (be it an electric vehicle [EV] or a rooftop
photovoltaic [PV] array), enabling more intelligent load dispatch and grid-
balancing decisions.
Verifiability and portability of data
The final pillar is embedding robust verification procedures, which ensure that
data—once registered or recorded—is cryptographically tamper-evident and
remains portable across the ecosystem. This includes cryptographic signatures,
proof-of-origin records, and permissioning models that uphold data sovereignty.
Together, these three building blocks—universal identity, machine-readable
structures, and verifiability—represent the minimal infrastructure necessary
to align physical energy flows with the information and transactional layers of
a modern, distributed system.

3.3
From grids to networks:
an interconnected energy world
Digital and machine-readable data streams
Imagine a world where every appliance’s specifications, certifications, and
ratings are digitally accessible in a standardized format. Combined with
machine-readable consumption and transaction data, this creates the
foundation for highly automated, analytics-driven, and intelligent decision-
making systems. For instance, just as machine-readable invoices underpin
the efficiency of modern tax systems by enabling seamless tracking and
compliance, such digital streams in the energy ecosystem could unlock
appliance-level metering, dynamic energy management, and precise control.
This level of granularity and automation could optimize energy usage,
enhance grid stability, and drive smarter energy policies.
32Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructure• Energy Producers can automate everything from certifications (like proof of
renewable generation) to contract settlements, while verifying their perfor-
mance with cryptographic signatures.
• Consumers gain new freedoms, such as frictionless switching to different
suppliers or direct peer-to-peer transactions. Households might securely
lease out unused battery capacity or easily join local microgrids for resiliency.
• Regulators and policymakers can embed oversight directly into the infrastruc-
ture, ensuring that safety, data privacy, and consumer protections scale with
the network. They also gain clearer visibility into real-time grid conditions,
improving policy effectiveness.Figure 5. The DEG vision encompasses all facets of the ecosystem.

33Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureDigital solutions, open standards, and advanced technologies like OCPP, OCPI,
IEC 61850, and initiatives such as Project Mercury27 are already enabling tar-
geted interoperability and communication for EV charging, DER management,
and clean technology integration. Building on this progress, these efforts have
successfully addressed specific needs, yet there remains an opportunity to
unlock even greater potential through universal composability across the energy
grid. A general-purpose foundation can amplify their impact significantly.
The Digital Energy Grid (DEG) can coordinate, complement, and unify existing
solutions-without displacing them. By enabling true interoperability across
systems, DEG provides the broader architecture on which these purpose-spe-
cific standards can be layered and expanded.

Bridging silos to capture
combinatorial value
Have we seen this before?
HTML
MP3 GIFPNG
MP4 SVGJPEGFigure 6. General purpose standard accommodates
and amplifies purpose-specific efforts.
A universal base layer can integrate and unify various purpose-specific standards,
enabling seamless interactions & creating combinatorial value.
For example, JPEG, GIF, SVG, MP4, & MP3 are purpose-specific standards, each
designed for a distinct data format- JPEG for still pictures, GIF for animations,
MP3 for audio, and MP4 for video. While each excels in its function, they cannot
inherently interact with one another. This is where a unifying base layer, like HTML
and HTTP, comes in. HTML allows different types of content – images, videos,
text, and audio – to coexist and function together within a single webpage, while
HTTP facilitates the smooth transfer of this multi-modal data across networks.
34Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureIf purpose-specific standards are like individual Lego blocks of different shapes
and sizes, the unifying base layer is the set of connectors and the instruction
guide that allows these blocks to fit together in meaningful ways. HTML and HTTP
act as the underlying fabric within which diverse elements can interoperate,
empowering innovators to create rich, interactive, and multi-modal experiences
that seamlessly combine different formats into something greater than the sum
of their parts.
Instead of creating competing standards that replace existing frameworks, a
well-architected base layer enables existing standards to work together cohesively.
This composability- the ability to combine different components into larger,
functional systems- ensures long-term adaptability. The base layer remains future-
proof, allowing new purpose-specific standards to be integrated without requiring
a complete overhaul of existing systems.
It’s important to note that DEG is not a fixed piece of software or a proprietary
technology stack. Instead, it is a vision for an evolving, interoperable, and modular
set of digital rails spanning the entire energy sector. Over time, the ecosystem
can accommodate new standards, tools, and security methods without fracturing.
Legacy systems can gradually integrate, while advanced players adopt next-
generation functionalities for even deeper automation or cross-sector linkages.
Here, we see infrastructure-thinking in action: the objective is not to enforce
uniformity by discarding existing systems, but to extend an invitation for each
actor to interconnect at the minimal required level. Just as the internet did not
demand that all computers be made by the same manufacturer, DEG does not
demand a universal software or hardware solution. Instead, it sets the stage so
that all participants—from an off-grid micro-hydro unit to a cutting-edge AI-driven
aggregator—can speak a shared digital language and produce verifiable records.
The next chapters examine how DEG can unlock new possibilities across different
parts of the energy ecosystem and how this vision, though ambitious, can be
realized through incremental actions and collaborative governance. By focusing
on the foundational digital building blocks today, we can ensure that energy systems
worldwide can adapt, innovate, and collaborate on a scale never before seen—
meeting both current demands and the pressing need for a sustainable future.

assets and participants are all “on the grid” in a digital sense, functions like
peer-to-peer trading, dynamic pricing, and transparent certification can emerge
without sacrificing the oversight that regulators, auditors, and financial institu-
tions require. By weaving these capabilities into a common infrastructure, the
Digital Energy Grid (DEG) sets the stage for more interconnected and imagi-
native solutions across the energy ecosystem.

A foundation for
synergistic growth
Each type of stakeholder—consumer, producer, operator, regulator, financing
agency—can adopt DEG at a different scale, reflecting local conditions or imme-
diate priorities. Yet as they link into the same underlying network, their combined
actions create a synergistic whole that is more robust, transparent, and ready
to evolve over time. Large utilities may be the first to standardize identities for
their generating units; local communities might join soon after, using the same
protocols to unlock real-time data on rooftop solar. Little by little, segments of
the energy ecosystem that used to operate in isolation merge into a more
unified environment.
At a macro level, this transformation carries meaningful implications for clean
energy adoption, grid stability, and the everyday experience of energy users.
Overcoming the longstanding fragmentation in how data is managed, trust is
established, and transactions are settled could deliver compounding benefits—a
better match of supply and demand, deeper cost savings, and less friction in
scaling up new infrastructure.

41Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureDEG weaves core functionalities, such as observability and secure transactions,
directly into the infrastructure. With universal identity, machine-readable
formats, and cryptographic assurance, the physical flow of electrons can be
coordinated with seamless, digital interactions. A flexible marketplace emerges,
fostering collaboration and innovation at scale while preserving reliable
oversight and guaranteed fairness for all. In place of patchwork pilots or
proprietary “smart grid” experiments, the industry gains a versatile digital
framework that encourages both public and private stakeholders to expand,
refine, and recombine capabilities.
This approach sets the stage for the next chapters, which illustrate the breadth
of possibilities DEG can unlock, from frictionless subsidy distribution to advanced
peer-to-peer trading and cloud battery services. By creating a single environment
where devices, participants, and transactions can interoperate, DEG aims to
reduce wasted effort, open new revenue opportunities, and realize an energy
transition that lives up to its transformative promises.

The DEG vision embodies
scale, diversity, openness,
and resilience for inclusive
energy systems
43Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureThe Digital Energy Grid (DEG) serves as more than a conceptual framework: it
offers a vision of an inclusive, global energy ecosystem, one that brings together
various technologies, participants, and use cases. Realizing this vision depends
on weaving essential design principles into every level of the grid. These prin-
ciples—openness, trust, resilience, public-private synergy, and flexibility—are
not abstract ideals but rather practical necessities that shape how DEG is
structured, governed, and adopted across different contexts.
While DEG is a powerful example of infrastructure thinking, it is only one of
several possible approaches to guide the energy transition. Our focus here is
on how infrastructure-led methods can make the system more robust and
adaptable, without prescribing a particular approach.
A key ambition for DEG is to function as a “network of networks,” unifying dis-
tributed energy resources (DERs), IoT-based devices, and energy infrastructures
spanning localities and national borders. This allows seamless interaction among
diverse systems, regardless of origin or design. For example, a city’s community
battery system can coordinate with a regional grid operator or an industrial
microgrid can share data with local regulators, all via the same coherent network.

Principles of DEG
Interoperability as a core principle
Interoperability goes beyond simply enabling communication; it ensures that
each subsystem—whether an EV charging network, a micro-hydro plant, or a
rooftop solar aggregator—uses minimal, open, shared digital standards. This
cuts the cost of “translating” data and simplifies how new entrants tap into
markets or compliance structures.
44Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureModular design allows anyone to build on the network
By unbundling problems and solutions into core, reusable building blocks with
open protocols and specifications, we can ensure that these components are
highly trusted and cost-effective for reuse by public and private entities. This
approach allows the ecosystem to combine these modular building blocks,
much like Lego pieces, to create tailored solutions that fit various needs.
By adopting a minimalist approach, the architecture is designed to excel at a
single function without imposing on or disrupting the rest of the workflow.
Minimizing unnecessary fragmentation
Instead of letting each entity build closed, proprietary systems, a widely shared
“digital backbone” reduces fragmentation at scale. It eliminates the repetition
of efforts —including identification, verification, and other forms of data rec-
onciliation—thereby enabling seamless interactions across the system, break-
ing siloes, and unlocking combinatorial benefits.
Design for evolution and adaptation
Technological progress can take place quickly, and rigid platforms risk becom-
ing obsolete. DEG’s open standards and protocols are designed for modular
upgrade paths, allowing new solutions to plug in or swap out without breaking
existing connections. This future-readiness lets participants upgrade hardware
or adopt new software without disrupting the entire system, thus preserving
backward compatibility and reducing disruption.
As millions of DERs join the energy grid, the challenges of ensuring reliability
and security multiply. Cyber threats, large-scale privacy breaches, or malicious
activities can threaten confidence in the ecosystem. In a decentralized envi-
ronment, the stakes become even higher—one vulnerability in a microgrid or
connected appliance could cascade across the system. DEG has been designed
keeping these stakes in mind.
5.2 Embedding trust, security,
and resilience at the core
Verification and cryptographic integrity
Verifiable data, identity systems, and cryptographic proofs are woven into the
design to guarantee that no node can falsify or tamper with asset metadata,
transactions, or operational logs without being detected. This is vital for maintaining
trust in transactions like peer-to-peer trading or flexible load contracts.
45Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureSecurity by default
Rather than bolting on security after deployment, the DEG framework treats
security and privacy as foundational requirements. For instance, standardized
protocols can specify cryptographic signatures for every data packet, ensuring
that private data is encrypted end-to-end and that only authorized parties
can access, authenticate or alter it with consent.
Resilience and redundancy
A robust system is one that can bounce back from localized failures. DEG’s
decentralized network architecture is designed to avoid single points of failure
by enabling different players and solutions to plug in when needed, and to
incorporate redundancy in data storage, node operation, and validation. This
reduces the likelihood that a local outage or security event spirals into a major,
system-wide disruption.
Building a digital energy infrastructure that spans countries and continents requires
broad collaboration among governments, regulators, utilities, technology devel-
opers, and grassroots innovators. While public institutions lay down essential
guardrails, private entities bring capital, expertise, and adaptability that can
accelerate widespread adoption. Co-creation through pilot projects and shared
frameworks can unite these strengths: for instance, a local aggregator might
partner with a national utility to test real-time price signals or plug-and-play
solar kits, with results feeding back into broader policy and market designs.
This also opens doors for innovation across the system, by different kinds of
participants to solve a diverse range of problems in the ecosystem. By lower-
ing barriers for smaller players or specialized startups, synergy can extend
solutions to underserved areas, ensuring that no segment of the energy com-
munity is left behind. Over time, success stories from local experiments can
inspire new entrants in other regions, creating a positive feedback loop that
drives further improvement.
The energy landscape varies from one context to another. Megacities may
emphasize rapid EV adoption and large-scale renewables, while smaller towns
might concentrate on community-level microgrids or shared solar. DEG vision
acknowledges this diversity by enabling “modular” adoption of its core ele-
ments, adjusted to local conditions and readiness levels.
5.3 Fostering public-private
synergies for scale and innovation
5.4 Ensuring flexibility for
diverse energy futures
46Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureModular, asynchronous approaches
One region could begin by assigning unique digital identities to each rooftop
solar installation, while another might prioritize data structures for EV charging
stations or advanced grid automation. Each domain can adopt the portions of
the DEG framework that address its immediate challenges without losing com-
patibility with future expansions.
Equitable access and inclusivity
A universal framework means that the same open protocols and identity systems
can be used by large utilities and small local energy cooperatives alike. This
levels the playing field, so even resource-constrained communities can tap
into modern grid functionalities—like demand response or dynamic tariffs—and
benefit from a shared network.
Adapting to emerging technologies
Flexible design also ensures that DEG can incorporate new capabilities. Whether
that’s hydrogen-based microgrids, AI agents scheduling load in real time, or
advanced carbon-trading algorithms, the grid can keep evolving in ways that
respect local differences while preserving overarching interoperability.
By incorporating scale, diversity, openness, and resilience as core design pil-
lars, the Digital Energy Grid aims to create an environment in which partici-
pants—large or small—can thrive. Openness frees them to experiment, trust
mechanisms help them transact and collaborate safely, and well-defined
governance structures support further expansion and innovation. The outcome
is not just a patchwork of discrete fixes, but a comprehensive ecosystem that
helps societies everywhere pursue a secure, inclusive, and climate-aligned
energy future.
These same principles animate the examples explored in the next chapter,
where today’s projects and tomorrow’s innovations illustrate how a unified grid
can advance the transition from fragmented, siloed approaches to a flourish-
ing, resilient energy network.

48Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureThe potential applications of a Digital Energy Grid (DEG) span far beyond those
we can foresee today. A unified infrastructure for energy flows, information
exchange, and secure transactions could lead to breakthrough innovations that
resemble the chain reactions triggered by the emergence of the internet. Where
connectivity and interoperability become the norm, unforeseen “flywheel effects”
often follow—akin to how the web eventually paved the way for social media
platforms, the gig economy, and generative AI.
The examples in this chapter offer a glimpse into the wide variety of applications
and the concrete value DEG can bring to both existing and nascent fields. These
hypothetical scenarios are not exhaustive; rather, they illustrate what becomes
possible when energy assets, participants, and transactions operate under
common, interoperable standards.Note.

Illustrative diagram of solar subsidy distribution workflow in a non-DEG environment
In a remote village in a country with large electricity use in agricultural pump-
ing, the regional government is launching a solarisation initiative to accelerate
rooftop solar adoption. The goal is to shift households from dependency on
highly subsidised free electricity to becoming self-sufficient energy producers.
Through this program, families like Mihir’s, a local farmer, are eligible for a 50%
subsidy on 3kW rooftop solar panels, helping them reduce their reliance on
grid power.
However, under the current setup, Mihir’s path to solar adoption is a maze of
disjointed applications and verifications. He applies at three different places
for subsidy, loan (for the rest of capital) and net-metering connection to his
energy retailer. The lack of trust in the subsidy ecosystem prompts Mihir to
submit proof of identity, property ownership, and eligibility, only to face sep-
arate applications for each. Even after securing approvals, he buys the panels,
submits proof of purchase, ensures they meet specification requirements, and
confirms installation with a certified service provider.
6.1
Frictionless subsidy distribution
and effective solarisation
50Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureWith DEG, real-time telemetry from Mihir’s new solar system is accessible, with
Mihir’s digital consent, to both the government and the bank, ensuring trans-
parency in performance. Once the system is verified as active, his subsidy is
automatically disbursed, and the loan terms adjust accordingly. The siloed
steps collapse into a frictionless, auditable flow.
By removing administrative roadblocks, DEG merges finance, subsidies, and
energy data, cutting delays and reducing costs. It connects all key actors on a
single interface, so a process that used to be fraught with paperwork, repeat
verifications, and mistrust now flows seamlessly, giving Mihir and thousands
like him a straightforward path to going solar.
Effective

MihirFigure 9.2
Illustrative diagram of efficient solar subsidy distribution workflow in a DEG environment
This is an administrative burden for Mihir and a trust challenge for the govern-
ment, as the absence of real-time verifications slows approvals. To complicate
matters, the bank that finances Mihir’s solar project needs to see his subsidy
eligibility and pre-approval status before disbursing the loan—once again in a
siloed, manual process.
This is where the Digital Energy Grid (DEG) comes in. Built on common spec-
ifications and standards, DEG brings the government, banks, utilities, and ser-
vice providers into one cohesive digital ecosystem. Mihir’s subsidy application
becomes a single streamlined process—eligibility, approvals, and financing all
tied together. When he applies for financing, the bank seamlessly verifies his
pre-approved subsidy status. Certified vendors and skilled installers, each with
verifiable digital credentials, are discovered and contracted with minimal hassle.

Paul, a grid operator for a city with high penetration of EVs and air conditioning
loads, monitors rising electricity demand as summer heat peaks. Tasked with
maintaining grid stability, Paul partners with a platform called Flex to run a
citywide demand response (DR) program.
Emma, a consumer in Paul’s city, uses a bill-payment app called TapPay. Through
TapPay, she’s enrolled in a program that allows her air conditioner and EV char-
ger to respond to grid signals. On scorching days when electricity demand
soars, Paul’s platform automatically sends a message via TapPay, offering Emma
a small rebate if she allows her thermostat to adjust by a degree or two. Emma
taps “accept,” and her thermostat dials back slightly—she barely notices. Thou -
sands of other consumers do the same. This aggregate demand drop relieves
strain on Paul’s network, preventing brownouts. In return, the city meets its peak
needs without resorting to pricier generation options.Figure 10. Conceptual example of demand response program flow using DEG-enabled coordination.

Smart grid resilience:
Enhancing demand response programs
Later, settlement is equally seamless. Flex aggregates how much load was shed,
verifying each household’s response through real-time, cryptographically signed
data from the city’s smart meters. Emma’s discount is automatically credited
to her TapPay account, and Paul sees a neat, verifiable record of who partic-
ipated and by how much. In this way, the Digital Energy Grid fosters rapid coor-
dination among operators, aggregators, and consumers. It unifies the necessary
data streams—meter readings, price signals, device statuses—into a single trust-
worthy system, boosting grid resilience and rewarding everyday consumers for
contributing to stability.
52Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureDavid, a resource manager at a major utility, faces a steep evening peak on
hot days. Historically, the utility might have built expensive grid-scale battery
systems or fired up peaker plants to meet demand surges. But with the Dig-
ital Energy Grid, David has a new option: renting spare storage capacity from
households and businesses.
Sophia is a homeowner in the utility’s service area. She recently installed a
behind-the-meter battery to complement her rooftop solar. Through a plat-
form called PowerLink—which connects to DEG—Sophia can “lease out” part
of her battery’s unused capacity. She lists her availability and price on the
platform, visible to David at the utility. On a sweltering evening, David’s mon-
itoring system flags a sharp peak forecast. He logs onto PowerLink, sees hun-
dreds of batteries like Sophia’s offering capacity, and instantly dispatches
them to feed stored energy back into the grid for a few hours. Each household
or business battery discharges slightly, collectively meeting the peak without
requiring new infrastructure.

With DEG, Amit’s solar farm is registered with a universal, verifiable identity. Every
megawatt-hour it produces is securely logged, generating cryptographically
verifiable carbon credits. Sarah’s firm, located halfway across the globe, can
discover Amit’s credits on a global carbon marketplace integrated into DEG.
When Sarah’s company purchases these credits, the transaction and subse-
quent retirement of credits are automatically recorded. Amit sees immediate
payment, while regulators on both sides trust the cryptographic audit trail. The
once-complex cross-border carbon trade now flows seamlessly—no double
counting, no paper friction, and real proof of offset.
54Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureHans, a forward-thinking regulator in a developed country, sees electric vehi-
cles (EVs) as more than just energy consumers; they’re potential grid resources.
Working with local distribution companies, Hans launches a vehicle-to-grid
(V2G) policy pilot.
Irene, a researcher at an energy innovation lab, uses DEG to test new V2G
technologies. She enrolls volunteers like Thomas, an EV owner, who charges his
car overnight. Because Thomas’s EV is recognized by a universal identity in
DEG, his vehicle can securely share real-time battery info.
On hot afternoons, the lab’s system signals Thomas’s car to discharge a portion
of its battery back to the grid for an hour. In exchange, Thomas earns credits
on his energy bill. Simone, another EV user, times her charging to 2:00 a.m.
when wind power is abundant. The entire process is orchestrated seamlessly
through cryptographically verifiable data flows, so Hans’s regulatory office can
track how much capacity is injected back into the grid.
At scale, this V2G approach turns thousands of EVs into mini power plants—
stabilizing the grid, cutting costs, and accelerating the clean energy transition.

DEG and AI:
A symbiotic relationship
57Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureAI models in the energy sector rely heavily on high-quality, accessible data.
Digitalization has led to exponential data growth—smart meters generate far
more data than analog ones, and wind turbines may produce over 400 billion
data points annually. Yet, much of this information is fragmented and hard to
access, stalling AI research. DEG addresses this by offering shared data models
and standardized frameworks that allow innovators to access high-fidelity
datasets under proper permissions. By unifying fragmented data streams into
verifiable, searchable, and structured datasets, DEG reduces the costs of infer-
ence and training, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of AI tools used for
demand prediction and grid optimization. Its layered architecture—spanning
transaction, information, and energy flows—facilitates microdata generation
and large-scale sharing, ensuring scalable and efficient AI deployments.
Data centers are the backbone of AI computations, yet they consume enormous
amounts of energy. As noted by the IEA director, “there is no AI without energy.”
Many technology companies are now powering their data centers with renewable
energy to meet sustainability goals. However, rapid data center construction
challenges the energy sector to anticipate rising electricity demands, locate
optimal sites, and integrate these loads into the grid. DEG provides full visibility
into grid operations and enables micro and bidirectional energy transactions,
offering real-time monitoring of energy flows. This insight helps technology com-
panies strategically select data center locations based on regional energy loads,
renewable availability, and grid stability. DEG also streamlines permitting through
digital load signatures, programmable policies, and automated monitoring, while
regulators benefit from real-time, verifiable data feeds that enforce policies with
cryptographic security.
Unifying data
Sustainable data centers
Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a general-purpose technology—com-
parable in impact to the steam engine or electricity—that is set to transform
both the global economy and the energy system. AI advances require cut-
ting-edge computations and vast, high-quality datasets, raising questions
about how to meet its increasing energy needs. Simultaneously, AI offers
opportunities to reshape the energy sector by enhancing grid flexibility, boost-
ing efficiency, accelerating clean energy adoption, and driving decarbonization
efforts. In this intertwined landscape, the Digital Energy Grid (DEG) plays a
pivotal role, powering AI while enabling AI to optimize energy systems.
7.1
DEG powers AI
58Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureIntegrated measurability within DEG enables technology companies to deter-
mine in real time whether the power received from the grid comes from
renewable sources. This precision allows non-urgent tasks to be rescheduled
to times when renewable energy is available, matching each energy unit to a
“zero-carbon electron.” Such carbon-aware computing practices not only
lower energy consumption and emissions but also contribute to grid stabil-
ity by smoothing demand spikes.
The increasing decentralization and dynamism of energy systems create com-
plexity and coordination challenges. DEG overcomes these by unifying frag-
mented systems, streamlining operations, and reducing coordination overhead.
When paired with AI-powered automation, everyday energy processes become
seamlessly optimized in real time. Imagine instructing your home assistant,
“Minimize my monthly energy costs,” and having it analyze real-time energy
prices, demand, and supply data to execute secure, immutable micro-contracts
automatically. This is possible because DEG unifies local P2P energy markets,
smart appliances, and grid operations.
Cities, too, can benefit from AI agents managing complex systems. For instance,
an AI-enabled public transport system integrated with DEG could predict pas-
senger demand, optimize routes, and manage the charging schedules of elec-
tric buses. In such a system, an e-bus driver might receive an AI-assisted
recommendation to locate and reserve the nearest charging station automat-
ically. Similarly, businesses can use AI agents to automate energy transactions,
prioritize green energy suppliers, verify credentials, and negotiate contracts—
all while ensuring regulatory compliance.
Smart demand response for data centers
Transactional AI and an agentic energy ecosystem
DEG’s unified data allows AI models to be trained on large datasets, including
meteorological forecasts and historical grid usage, to predict energy demand
with high precision. A smart grid powered by AI can analyze hourly trends to
identify surges in energy usage and automatically schedule energy distribution.
Stored surplus energy in batteries, for example, can be deployed during peak
demand periods, or surplus energy can be sold back to the grid when supply
exceeds demand. This real-time forecasting and scheduling, enabled by DEG’s
Demand shifting and scheduling
7.2
AI elevates DEG
59Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureinteroperability across grids, distributed energy resources (DERs), and smart
appliances, results in a more resilient and efficient energy market while driving
further investment in renewable energy.
One of AI’s most promising applications is predictive maintenance. With DEG
data, AI can continuously monitor grid performance, detect anomalies, and
predict failures before they cause major disruptions. This proactive approach
minimizes downtime and reduces operational costs. Regulators, too, can employ
AI-driven anomaly detection to monitor data-sharing frameworks, ensuring
compliance with consent protocols and protecting sensitive information.
Advanced voice interfaces and chatbots powered by large language models
(LLMs) help non-experts navigate complex energy systems. For example, a
community energy manager in a microgrid might simply say, “Balance the load
to maximize solar energy usage,” and the system, with minimal human super-
vision, will adjust power distribution autonomously. This integration of natural
language processing with DEG’s data interoperability makes energy management
more accessible and transparent.
Predictive maintenance and anomaly detection
Seamless user interaction

A symbiotic future
Artificial intelligence and the Digital Energy Grid are set to mutually reinforce one
another. AI’s growing computational capabilities and data needs drive the devel-
opment of sustainable energy infrastructures, while DEG’s robust data-sharing
and real-time optimization empower AI to become more adaptive and efficient.
AI models, using data from DEG, can combine satellite imagery with information
on energy loads and transmission lines to identify optimal locations for solar
installations and other renewable projects. By mapping grid networks and ana-
lyzing energy transactions, AI helps optimize the mix of renewable energy sources
and improve the efficiency of both fossil fuel and renewable power plants. This
strategic approach supports low-emission policies and accelerates decarbon-
ization efforts.
Identifying decarbonisation opportunities
60Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureAs Fatih Birol noted, “Balancing AI’s energy demands with its transformative
potential requires unprecedented cooperation across sectors and borders.”
The future of energy and AI demands a global effort uniting industry leaders,
policymakers, and innovators. Through effective integration of AI and energy
systems, we can reduce emissions, drive sustainability, and generate significant
social and economic value, ensuring a prosperous and greener future for all.
Principles for energy and AI
These principles, as discussed at the IEA Global Conference on Energy
and AI29, offer a sound framework to unlock the potential of AI vis-à-vis
the energy sector. A unified energy system that generates useful data,
is interoperable, transparent and secure makes it possible for efficient
integration of AI-based solutions in the sector.
DEG is one such framework that could help realise some of the desirable
outcomes aligned with these principles.

An ambitious vision
meets calibrated action
62Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureRegions can begin by integrating the most relevant features. For instance, a
place already rich in distributed solar might start by assigning digital identities
to rooftop installations. A grid with widespread smart meters may prioritize
machine-readable, real-time data for demand response. Since DEG is
technology-neutral, no single path is forced on every participant.
Implementations can evolve over time. A utility that initially uses DEG for ver-
ifying new solar interconnections can expand to real-time market integration
or advanced services like peer-to-peer energy trading. Once foundational
elements (universal identity, verifiability, machine-readable metadata) are in
place, layering advanced capabilities becomes more straightforward.
Not all markets move in lockstep. Early adopters can pioneer robust governance
and pilot programs that later adopters build upon. Interoperable protocols
ensure that even a partial rollout can link up with broader networks elsewhere,
achieving global reach piece by piece.
Every region and market stand at a unique juncture. Some countries already
have advanced digital payment systems, widespread broadband, and robust
grid automation, while others are still expanding electrification or introducing
basic metering infrastructure. DEG’s design accommodates this diversity through
a modular architecture and asynchronous rollout.
Context-aware adoption
Future-ready, incremental growth
Asynchronous timelines
DEG represents an ambitious concept, aiming to unify energy systems globally
under a common digital infrastructure. Yet its success depends on practical,
incremental steps that acknowledge local contexts, variable market readiness,
and differing policy environments. Balancing ambition with a pragmatic roadmap
allows the framework to adapt, experiment, and evolve in stages without losing
sight of the broader objective: a trusted, scalable, and inclusive energy ecosystem.
8.1
DEG vision is context-aware,
future-ready, and asynchronous
63Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureA working example of these principles is beginning to take shape through the
Unified Energy Interface (UEI)30
, an open network enabled by Beckn Protocol31
for electric vehicle charging, peer-to-peer trading, and demand-response
actions. Initiatives like these illustrate how multiple stakeholders across regions
can gradually align to a shared vision while tackling real-world challenges.
DEG is neither a single product nor a monolithic technology solution. It is a
flexible framework that unifies multiple stakeholders, bridging existing systems
and paving the way for new approaches. It complements ongoing advancements
in grid infrastructure, hardware design, and energy storage breakthroughs; it
does not replace them.
8.2
DEG as a catalyst for
a unified energy future
Addressing climate goals, universal energy access, and rapid demand growth
also requires major strides in hardware uniformity, grid upgrades, policy reforms,
and market-based incentives. Physical generation, distribution, and storage
assets must still be built or retrofitted.
The digital backbone that DEG offers can magnify the impact of emerging
technologies. Advanced battery chemistries or new cost-effective solar mod-
ules become far more valuable when integrated into a coordinated marketplace,
tracked by verifiable data, and governed by transparent rules. Similarly, local
pilot programs can scale more easily if they adhere to widely recognized,
open standards.
The world’s energy landscape is diverse, with unpredictable changes in eco-
nomics, politics, and technology. DEG’s modular design is meant to handle this
uncertainty. A wide array of stakeholders—from city governments to rural coop-
eratives—can adopt the framework in steps, each focusing on their immediate
objectives while contributing to a larger, global vision.

A universal digital infrastructure that touches grids, markets, and consumers at
scale requires a strong governance model. Public and private innovation can
thrive on robust public rails that ensure inclusivity, fairness, and competition.
Effective governance is essential to establish guardrails that protect stakehold-
ers’ interests without stifling creativity or free market dynamics. By balancing
regulation with open access, the system should foster equitable opportunities
while safeguarding against exclusion and promoting sustainable growth.
A notable strength of DEG is the ability to embed policies directly into the
infrastructure itself. Regulatory requirements—like emissions caps, dynamic
tariffs, or renewable portfolio standards—can be encoded as digital rules that
operate autonomously. This lowers enforcement costs and ensures that com-
pliance processes scale in tandem with expanding networks. At the same time,
DEG enables local regulators and governments to maintain autonomy and sov-
ereignty in implementing the framework within their jurisdictions, ensuring that
deployment aligns with regional policies, priorities, and energy transition goals.
Policymakers play a crucial role in shaping resilient digital energy systems by
fostering innovation, interoperability, and security. This involves creating adapt-
able regulatory frameworks, promoting open standards for seamless integration,
and aligning public utilities with the vision of unified energy systems. Encour-
aging consumer participation and mobilising private sector investment are key
to driving demand-side flexibility and scaling smart technologies. Additionally,
robust cybersecurity measures must be prioritised to protect critical infra-
structure and ensure the resilience of these systems in an increasingly inter-
connected energy landscape.
DEG cannot develop in a vacuum. To bring the vision to life, a broad coalition of
utilities, technology companies, regulators, financiers, and civil society groups
must unite in shaping the underlying infrastructure. Regardless of where one
stands in the digital maturity journey, DEG provides a scalable and adaptable
framework that integrates existing systems while enabling future advancements.
This paper invites all stakeholders—governments, private enterprises, community
organizations, and academic institutions—to engage in building and refining the
DEG approach. Together, the aim is to overhaul the current system’s inefficiencies,
harness new opportunities, and move toward a more sustainable and equitable
energy future.

ments32
. Its success stems from design principles such as interoperability, low
cost, and ease of access, demonstrating how scalable infrastructure can drive
financial inclusion, innovation and economic participation.
Brazil’s Pix payment system
Pix, launched in November 2020, rapidly expanded digital payment adoption
in Brazil, adding 71.5 million users by December 2022 and serving 153 million
individuals (around 75% of the population) and 15 million businesses by March
2024 33. By focusing on speed, flexibility, and interface standardisation, Pix
enabled small merchants and startups to thrive, highlighting how infrastructure
thinking can bridge financial and technological divides.
Estonia’s X-Road: A pioneer in digital governance
Estonia’s X-Road, launched in 2001, exemplifies transformative power at scale.
It has digitised 99% of government services, saving 1,407 years of working time
each year34
. This comprehensive digital infrastructure has far-reaching effects:
attracting global entrepreneurs through e-residency, inspiring similar systems
in other countries, and positioning Estonia as a leader in digital governance. The
X-Road system has enabled rapid response during crises and contributed sig-
nificantly to Estonia’s reputation as an innovative digital society.
Open networks
The implementation of Open Transaction Networks (OTNs)35 for commerce, mobil-
ity and other sectors particularly through the Open Network for Digital Commerce
(ONDC), exemplifies the lowering of transaction costs and barriers to entry, thereby
cultivating an environment ripe for innovation, competition and market expansion.
67Digital Energy GridA vision for a unified energy infrastructureTogether, these initiatives highlight the profound potential of population-scale
digital infrastructure to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and foster inclusion
across global economies. These examples offer policymakers actionable insights
for designing transformative systems in diverse contexts.
Direct benefit transfers
Welfare programs leveraging digital infrastructure, such as India’s PAHAL37 for
LPG subsidies, showcase how direct benefit transfers reduce inefficiencies,
optimise targeting, and enhance transparency. These systems provide
valuable models for subsidy reforms in other sectors, such as energy.
The ONDC (ondc.org)36
, underpinned by Beckn protocol (becknprotocol.io), is
pioneering a significant shift in the transaction economy, demonstrating how
open, protocol-based systems can fundamentally alter market dynamics and
foster inclusive growth in domestic and global trade.
